3 2 2
##start
st 4 0
##end
end 4 6
4 0 4
1 4 2

st-1
3-4
2-4
1-5
6-5
end-6
1-2

3-st
```
> First line: amount of ants
>
> room_1_name room_1_x_pos room_1_y_pos
>
> room_2_name room_2_x_pos room_2_y_pos
>
> ...
>
> The map's file must have ##start and ##end commands
>
> Room after command ##start or ##end will be marked as start room or end room respectively
>
> After rooms have to be written connections between rooms.
